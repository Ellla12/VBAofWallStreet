# Module 2: VBA of Wall Street

## Overview of the Project
Steve is a recent Finance graduate and his parents will be his first client. He will be helping them manage their finance and looking into their current stocks with DAQO and is looking into diversifying their portfolio.

The purpose of the analysis in the VBA Challenge is to refactor the code from this Module to speed up processing time and make the code more efficient. To do that, the code will need to loop through all the data one time.

## Results
### Stock Performance 2017 vs 2018
![Stock Performance 2017 vs 2018](https://github.com/Ellla12/VBAofWallStreet/blob/main/Resources/All%20Stocks%20Analysis.PNG)
From the VBA Analysis, we can conclude that All Stocks performance during 2017 performed better than 2018. The Return in 2018 peformed poorly and provided a negative return.

### Execution Time Comparison

![Execution Time Refactored](https://github.com/Ellla12/VBAofWallStreet/blob/main/Resources/run_time_refactored.PNG)
The original execution time for the VBA Challenge code was about 0.66 seconds for both 2017 and 2018. After refactoring the code, the code now has an execution time of 0.109 seconds for both 2017 and 2018. By refactoring the code, we were able to increase the efficiency of the code by about 80 to 85%.

## Summary
### Advantages and Disadvantages of Refactoring Code
The advantages of refactoring codes are:
* Improves the overall design of the software
* Makes the software easier to understand
* Helps with debugging the code
* Helps with overall efficiency of the code

The disadvantages of refactoring codes are:
* Large Risk Factor when Application is big
* Sometimes the cost of refactoring is more expensive than rewriting the code

### How Advantages/Disadvantages applies to the VBA Challenge
The VBA Challenge benefits from refactoring. As it is not a large application it does not take too much time or effort to refactor the code. Also, since the application isn't too complicated there is not a large risk of breaking the code. The initial execution time of the code was improved by about 80% with refactoring.
