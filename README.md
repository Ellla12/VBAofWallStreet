# Module 2: VBA of Wall Street

## Overview of the Project
Steve is a recent Finance graduate and his parents will be his first client. He will be helping them manage their finance and looking into their current stocks with DAQO and is looking into diversifying their portfolio.

The purpose of the analysis in the VBA Challenge is to refactor the code from this Module to speed up processing time and make the code more efficient. To do that, the code will need to loop through all the data one time.

## Results
